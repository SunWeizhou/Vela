# BodySeek ARCH-08 / PR8 Recovery replay evidence

Status: app-target oracle evidence; package parity remains explicitly blocked.
No scoring formula or algorithm-version change is included in this slice.

`RecoveryScoreEngine` and `RecoveryScoreInput` currently live under
`VelaApp/Scoring/Recovery`. `BodySeekDomain` intentionally reports Recovery as
unavailable until an independently reviewed adapter migration is scheduled.
This harness therefore freezes the current app oracle rather than duplicating
the formula in the package.

## Deterministic baseline

The replay evaluates at `2026-07-31T12:00:00Z` using a Gregorian UTC clock,
14-day HRV/RHR/respiratory histories, HRV 54 against baseline 50, RHR 57
against baseline 60, sleep 77.43, and yesterday's strain 52. The canonical
fingerprint is recorded in `docs/baselines/recovery-replay-fixtures.json`.

The oracle returns `68.8497077483`, confidence `high`, algorithm version
`recovery.v2.0.0`, and no missing inputs. The executable assertions live in
`VelaAppTests/RecoveryReplaySensitivityTests.swift`.

## Sensitivity evidence

| Case | Controlled change | Value | Confidence |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| baseline | none | 68.8497077483 | high |
| short-sleep-360 | sleep score 53.62 | 62.8972077483 | high |
| high-strain-90 | prior strain 90 | 59.6418762029 | high |
| high-temperature | temperature delta +1.0°C | 60.8497077483 | high |
| low-spo2 | SpO2 93% | 60.8497077483 | high |

When both cardiovascular signals are absent, the result remains `nil`, data
coverage is `unavailable`, formatted score is `--`, and both missing input
names are retained. No missing value is coerced to zero.
